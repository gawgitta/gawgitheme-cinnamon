Gawgitta's (un)original Cinnamon theme

This my personal Cinnamon theme. It is mostly a mashup of these two spices:
https://cinnamon-spices.linuxmint.com/themes/view/Windows-10-Dark
https://cinnamon-spices.linuxmint.com/themes/view/CBlack

Very little of the code within is my original work. Most of it comes from the Windows-10-Dark theme, with the start menu coming from CBlack. The only part of this that is my own work is combining the two as well as redoing many of the colors both in the CSS files and in some of the assets. The CREDITS file is taken mostly from Windows-10-Dark's credits, with both the creator of CBlack and myself added.

This is only on github for my own convenience. I do not intend for anyone else to use it, but I also can't stop you if you want to.
